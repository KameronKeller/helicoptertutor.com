      <hr>
      <p>Through the teaching of flight instructor applicants, the need was recognized to have a consolidated resource to aid in the preparation of lessons.</p>

      <p>Our goal is to improve the quality of instruction given by flight instructors, help prepare students for earning pilot certificates, and provide organized resources to anyone who might find it useful.</p>
